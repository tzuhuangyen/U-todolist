This project focuses on practicing DOM manipulation, event listeners, and local storage implementation. The objective is to create a to-do list application that allows users to manage tasks and retains data across browser sessions.

By manipulating the DOM, users can add, remove, and update tasks dynamically. The application integrates local storage to store the to-do list data persistently. This ensures data availability even after closing and reopening the browser.

Implementing local storage enhances usability and convenience. Users can rely on the system to retain their task list, eliminating the need to start from scratch each time they use the application
